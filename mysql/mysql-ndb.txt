Installing a MySQL Cluster Binary Release on Linux
	(mysql-cluster-gpl-7.3.9-linux-i686-glibc23.tar.gz or mysql-cluster-gpl-7.4.4-linux-i686-glibc23.tar.gz)
	
SQL nodes.  On each of the machines designated to host SQL nodes, perform the following steps as
	the system root user:	
	
	1,perform the following steps as the system root user:
	Check your /etc/passwd and /etc/group files (or use whatever tools are provided by your
		operating system for managing users and groups) to see whether there is already a mysql group
		and mysql user on the system.If they are not already present, create a new mysql user group, and then add a
		mysql user to this group:
	shell> groupadd mysql
	shell> useradd -g mysql mysql
	
	2. Change location to the directory containing the downloaded file, unpack the archive, and create a
		symbolic link named mysql to the mysql directory
	shell> cd /var/tmp
	shell> tar -C /usr/local -xzvf mysql-cluster-gpl-7.4.4-linux2.6.tar.gz
	shell> ln -s /usr/local/mysql-cluster-gpl-7.4.4-linux2.6-i686 /usr/local/mysql
	
	3. Change location to the mysql directory and run the supplied script for creating the system databases:
	shell> cd mysql
	shell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
	
	4. Set the necessary permissions for the MySQL server and data directories
	shell> chown -R root .
	shell> chown -R mysql data
	shell> chgrp -R mysql .
	
	5. Copy the MySQL startup script to the appropriate directory, make it executable, and set it to start when
		the operating system is booted up
	shell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/rc.d/init.d/
	shell> chmod +x /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql.server
	shell> chkconfig --add mysql.server
	(The startup scripts directory may vary depending on your operating system and version¡ªfor example,
		in some Linux distributions, it is /etc/init.d.)
	Here we use Red Hat's chkconfig for creating links to the startup scripts; use whatever means is
		appropriate for this purpose on your platform, such as update-rc.d on Debian.

	Remember that the preceding steps must be repeated on each machine where an SQL node is to reside.
	
Data nodes.  Installation of the data nodes does not require the mysqld binary. Only the MySQL Cluster
	data node executable ndbd (single-threaded) or ndbmtd (multi-threaded) is required. These binaries can
	also be found in the .tar.gz archive. Again, we assume that you have placed this archive in /var/tmp	
	
	As system root (that is, after using sudo, su root, or your system's equivalent for temporarily assuming
		the system administrator account's privileges), perform the following steps to install the data node binaries
		on the data node hosts:
	1. Change location to the /var/tmp directory, and extract the ndbd and ndbmtd binaries from the
		archive into a suitable directory such as /usr/local/bin
	shell> cd /var/tmp
	shell> tar -zxvf mysql-5.6.23-ndb-7.4.4-linux-i686-glibc23.tar.gz
	shell> cd mysql-5.6.23-ndb-7.4.4-linux-i686-glibc23
	shell> cp bin/ndbd /usr/local/bin/ndbd
	shell> cp bin/ndbmtd /usr/local/bin/ndbmtd
	
	2. Change location to the directory into which you copied the files, and then make both of them
		executable
	shell> cd /usr/local/bin
	shell> chmod +x ndb*
	
	The preceding steps should be repeated on each data node host.
	
Management nodes.  Installation of the management node does not require the mysqld binary.
	Only the MySQL Cluster management server (ndb_mgmd) is required; you most likely want to install the
	management client (ndb_mgm) as well. Both of these binaries also be found in the .tar.gz archive.
	Again, we assume that you have placed this archive in /var/tmp
	
	As system root, perform the following steps to install ndb_mgmd and ndb_mgm on the management node host:
	
	1. Change location to the /var/tmp directory, and extract the ndb_mgm and ndb_mgmd from the archive
		into a suitable directory such as /usr/local/bin
	shell> cd /var/tmp
	shell> tar -zxvf mysql-5.6.23-ndb-7.4.4-linux2.6-i686.tar.gz
	shell> cd mysql-5.6.23-ndb-7.4.4-linux2.6-i686
	shell> cp bin/ndb_mgm* /usr/local/bin
	
	2. Change location to the directory into which you copied the files, and then make both of them executable:
	shell> cd /usr/local/bin
	shell> chmod +x ndb_mgm*
	
	
Installing MySQL Cluster from RPM

	Data nodes.  On a computer that is to host a cluster data node it is necessary to install only the server
		RPM. To do so, copy this RPM to the data node host, and run the following command as the system root
		user, replacing the name shown for the RPM as necessary to match that of the RPM downloaded from the
		MySQL web site
	shell> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-7.3.9-1.sles11.i386.rpm
	Although this installs all MySQL Cluster binaries, only the program ndbd or ndbmtd (both in /usr/sbin)
		is actually needed to run a MySQL Cluster data node.
		
	SQL nodes.  On each machine to be used for hosting a cluster SQL node, install the server RPM
		by executing the following command as the system root user, replacing the name shown for the RPM as
		necessary to match the name of the RPM downloaded from the MySQL web site:
	shell> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-7.3.9-1.sles11.i386.rpm
	This installs the MySQL server binary (mysqld) with NDB storage engine support in the /usr/sbin
		directory, as well as all needed MySQL Server support files. It also installs the mysql.server and
		mysqld_safe startup scripts (in /usr/share/mysql and /usr/bin, respectively). The RPM installer
		should take care of general configuration issues (such as creating the mysql user and group, if needed)
		automatically
	To administer the SQL node (MySQL server), you should also install the client RPM, as shown here:
	shell> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-client-gpl-7.3.9-1.sles11.i386.rpm
	
	Management nodes.  To install the MySQL Cluster management server, it is necessary only to use the
		server RPM. Copy this RPM to the computer intended to host the management node, and then install
		it by running the following command as the system root user (replace the name shown for the RPM as
		necessary to match that of the server RPM downloaded from the MySQL web site):
	shell> rpm -Uhv MySQL-Cluster-server-gpl-7.3.9-1.sles11.i386.rpm
	Although this RPM installs many other files, only the management server binary ndb_mgmd (in the /
		usr/sbin directory) is actually required for running a management node. The server RPM also installs
		ndb_mgm, the NDB management client

Create a new text file using a text editor such as Notepad, and input the following information:
[ndbd default]
# Options affecting ndbd processes on all data nodes:
NoOfReplicas=2 # Number of replicas
DataDir=C:/mysql/cluster-data # Directory for each data node's data files
								# Forward slashes used in directory path,
								# rather than backslashes. This is correct;
								# see Important note in text
DataMemory=80M # Memory allocated to data storage
IndexMemory=18M # Memory allocated to index storage
					# For DataMemory and IndexMemory, we have used the
					# default values. Since the "world" database takes up
					# only about 500KB, this should be more than enough for
					# this example Cluster setup.
[ndb_mgmd]
# Management process options:
HostName=192.168.0.10 # Hostname or IP address of management node
DataDir=C:/mysql/bin/cluster-logs # Directory for management node log files
[ndbd]
# Options for data node "A":
 # (one [ndbd] section per data node)
